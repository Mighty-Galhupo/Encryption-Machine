# Encryption-Machine
This is a simple python program made with the intent of converting messages to a format not easily readable without access to this program.

It uses little to no actual encryption, containing only letter shifts (such as the Caesar Cypher where each letter in the message is changed to the letter two positions ahead of it in the alphabet) a human with enough spare time could convert to and from regular text. With a long enough encryption key it would take far too much time to manually convert the message however.

Planned Future Updates:
- Adding further methods of letter shifting (suggestions open)
- Adding a new mode where the user may convert all the text in a file rather than a typed in message
